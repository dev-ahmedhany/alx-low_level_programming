# 0x15. C - File I/O

## 0. Tread lightly, she is near

Write a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

Prototype: ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters);
where letters is the number of letters it should read and print
returns the actual number of letters it could read and print
if the file can not be opened or read, return 0
if filename is NULL return 0
if write fails or does not write the expected amount of bytes, return 0

Requiescat
by Oscar Wilde

Tread lightly, she is near
Under the snow,
Speak gently, she can hear
The daisies grow.

All her bright golden hair
Tarnished with rust,
She that was young and fair
Fallen to dust.

Lily-like, white as snow,
She hardly knew
She was a woman, so
Sweetly she grew.

Coffin-board, heavy stone,
Lie on her breast,
I vex my heart alone,
She is at rest.

Peace, Peace, she cannot hear
Lyre or sonnet,
All my life's buried here,
Heap earth upon it.

## 1. Under the snow

Create a function that creates a file.

Prototype: `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content);`
where filename is the name of the file to create and text_content is a NULL terminated string to write to the file
Returns: 1 on success, -1 on failure (file can not be created, file can not be written, write “fails”, etc…)
The created file must have those permissions: rw-------. If the file already exists, do not change the permissions.
if the file already exists, truncate it
if filename is NULL return -1
if text_content is NULL create an empty file

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x15. File descriptors and permissions$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "main.h"

/**
 * main - check the code
 *
 * Return: Always 0.
 */
int main(int ac, char **av)
{
    int res;

    if (ac != 3)
    {
        dprintf(2, "Usage: %s filename text\n", av[0]);
        exit(1);
    }
    res = create_file(av[1], av[2]);
    printf("-> %i)\n", res);
    return (0);
