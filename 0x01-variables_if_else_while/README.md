## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-520693284 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative 
-973398895 is negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative

## 1. The last digit

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

> The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
> You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
> The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-last_digit.c -o 1-last_digit
