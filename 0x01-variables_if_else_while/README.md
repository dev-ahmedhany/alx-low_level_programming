## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-positive_or_negative.c -o 0-positive_or_negative
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./0-positive_or_negative

## 1. The last digit

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

> You can find the source code here
> The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
> You don’t have to understand what rand, srand, and RAND_MAX do. Please do not touch this code
> The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
n, followed by
the string is, followed by
if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-last_digit.c -o 1-last_digit
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./1-last_digit

## 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 2-print_alphabet.c -o 2-print_alphabet
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./2-print_alphabet 
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$
```

## 3. alphABET

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar three times in your code

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-print_alphabets.c -o 3-print_alphabets
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./3-print_alphabets | cat -e
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ$
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ 
```

## 4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

Print all the letters except q and e
You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
All your code should be in the main function
You can only use putchar twice in your code

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 4-print_alphabt.c -o 4-print_alphabt
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./4-print_alphabt 
abcdfghijklmnoprstuvwxyz
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./4-print_alphabt | grep [eq]
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ 
```

## 5. Numbers

Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

All your code should be in the main function

```bash
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 5-print_numbers.c -o 5-print_numbers
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ ./5-print_numbers 
0123456789
julien@ubuntu:~/0x01$ 
```
